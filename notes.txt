x clone html & css

x Test preset css or create new one
	-shrink down side meue to organic width
		-everything seems to be margin-right auto??
			-maybe positioning in flex-box
		-Try: div for menu, articles and weather-box	
		(***This worked***)


asses and corect media query problem regarding:
	-mobile 
		x - ~877px: need to decrease or delete the margin 
			around
			.articles-articles & .local_weather_box
				-// or keep it to use instead of creating a 
				new div for the mobile menu symbol
		-Solution: left it alone
		x - Once the .local_weather_box goes below the articles: 		
		either readjust margin, display:none, or move 			mobile menu to it's own div about the main wrapper. 

		x - Adjust articles img
			-remove or adjust the width and height of .articles-articles 
				-This will in increase the overall size. this 
				inclearse the size of the picture (if it does not adjust he percentage in .article-img). It will also increase the lenth of the article.







Medium-term:
1. Articles section sidr (adjust css in conjunction with js)
	a. js= close sidr menu when article section is clicked.


Long-term:
Header DRY UPDATE
set max-width for everything
